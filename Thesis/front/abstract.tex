\chapter{Abstract}
%The microservice architecture is a currently emerging pattern in software engineering.
%An application developed using the microservice architecture consists of many services that aim to fullfil only one single purpose.
%Instead of having one huge application, the logic is split into numerous smaller units that communicate with each other.
%Therefore function calls within the application migrate to remote calls over the network.
%Those remote calls between te services of the deployment have to provide confidentiality integrity and authentication.
%This thesis compares two authentication mechanisms used to provide service-to-service authentication.
%The concepts of the compared authentication mechanisms are explained in detail and their challenges and motivations are discussed.
%The aim of this thesis is helping developers to choose the correct authentication mechanisms for their microservice deployment.
%
%Whether one of the authentication mechanisms is superior or not always depends on needs of the project.
